# 17-leaflet-challenge - Data Analysis and Visualization Course
# JSON to HTML map plot
# Function
The purpose of this map is to show the locations and magnitudes of all the earthquakes in the past seven days. This is done by taking the GeoJSON data from USGS.gov and transporting it into an HTML map layer that can plot it over a map of the world. When clicking on the plotted circle you can see the specific long, lat, city and magnitude of that earthquake. This map updates with every update of the USGS site. 
# Organization
The Javascript code is in the JS folder and communicates with index.HTML along with the GeoJSON website to pull the data. 
# How to Run
Download all the code and run it on a server. This will plot the map through HTML. 
# Result
A heat map of the world showing magnitude of earthquakes and their location.
